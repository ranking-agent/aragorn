to turn the original files from Kara into the rules going into robokop/aragorn we do the following:
1. remove any rule with precision (first numerical column) < 0.05.
2. remove any rule with "subclass, causes, contributes, causes_adverse_events" predicates

There's still something that has to be done by hand which is culling symmetric rules.  For something like related_to, there will be two rules, one pointing each direction.  One needs to be removed

Also in the 3hops, there are some funky has_part(a,b), has_part(b,a) that appear to be driven by robokop problems.  Removing them.
And keeping maybe the top 50 rules from 3-hops.

Also add the self rule treats->treats to the 2-hop rules by hand
