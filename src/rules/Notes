The current rules have been created through a somewhat complicated process:
1. Kara created rules
2. I used parse_to_trapi to filter out to a smaller number of rules that don't have as many false positives
3. Kara took those rules and added classes to them (and I did some cleaning)
4. I used print_rules and finalize_list to apply several filters
   * remove causes, contributes, causes_adverse_events from treats
   * Remove superclasses of the opposite (if the goal is decreases activity, don't include affects activity b/c it will allow increases activity)
   * Remove symmetrics
   * remove subclass rules
5. By hand, I went into kara_typed_rules/rules_with_types_cleaned_finalized.json and changed "biolink:correlated_with"
     to "biolink:positively_correlated_with"
6. For reasons unclear to me after all this, we still have a bunch of rules of this form:
    ?e  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b  ?e  biolink:similar_to  ?a   => ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
    For these I go into hand and edit the rule to be
    ?e  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b  ?e  biolink:similar_to  ?a   => ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
    Changing both the "Rule" and the edge in "template" by adding the correct qualifier
7. Also hand removed several rules:
x ?a  biolink:interacts_with  ?b  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b"
x ?b  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?a  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  biolink:affects_response_to  ?a  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b  ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?a  ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b"
x ?b  biolink:increases_response_to  ?a  ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?a  biolink:interacts_with  ?b  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?a  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  biolink:affects_response_to  ?a  ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?a  decreased_molecular_interaction_biolink:affects  ?b  ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?a  ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
x ?b  biolink:affects_response_to  ?a  ?a  increased_activity_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b
"?b  biolink:increases_response_to  ?a  ?a  increased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b   => ?a  decreased_activity_or_abundance_biolink:affects  ?b

Subsequently removed several rules or modified the node types where "contributes_to" was involved in chemical-gene rules.


This process is obviously roundabout and we are going to clarify it in the next round of rule minings.
