The current rules have been created through a somewhat complicated process:
1. Kara created rules
2. I used parse_to_trapi to filter out to a smaller number of rules that don't have as many false positives
3. Kara took those rules and added classes to them (and I did some cleaning)
4. I used print_rules and finalize_list to apply several filters
   * remove causes, contributes, causes_adverse_events from treats
   * Remove superclasses of the opposite (if the goal is decreases activity, don't include affects activity b/c it will allow increases activity)
   * Remove symmetrics
   * remove subclass rules

This process is obviously roundabout and we are going to clarify it in the next round of rule minings.
